        <p class="work-text">Hello there! I am Jared, welcome to my website! Unfortunately as 
                I am sure you can tell I am very new to coding websites, and tried 
                my best to create something with the basics of HTML and CSS. I 
                also used as bit of JavaScript to create the transition for a bit 
                of fun but it's obviously a little shambles LOL. I thought I would
                adapt the theme by splitting work and play to be the "opposites
                attract". Anyways, have fun learning a bit about me!</p>

        <p class="work-text"> 
            Currently I am 18 years old and going into my 2nd year of uni. I'm 
            here at UNSW studying actuarial studies and computer science 
            (but I'm lowkey thinking about dropping actuarial).

            As I'm not very far into my degree yet, I've only completed: 
            COMP1511, COMP1521, and COMP2521. However, these courses have underpinned
            a newfound passion for coding, and I am extremely dedicated to 
            learning anything required as a trainee!

            I'm in the middle of completing an internship regarding my other degree,
            which has been a very cool experience but it has made me think more
            about pursuing the computer science part of my degree. Thus I'm 
            applying for DevSoc!
