        Ever since I've been 4 years old I have played soccer. Every year 
        I play in a team and then play summer soccer once the season ends. 
        I feel like it's the sport that everyone gets put in when they're
        young, but it happened to stick with me to this day!
        </p>
        <p class="work-text">
        Alternatively, this past few months I've been playing a
        lot of golf, tennis and going surfing which has been insanely fun.
        I love being out in the sun and being around friends which these 
        are great for. I also like reading and playing guitar!
